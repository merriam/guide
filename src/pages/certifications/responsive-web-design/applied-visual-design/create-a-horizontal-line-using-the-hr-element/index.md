## Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element

Note that the **hr** tag is self-closing.  This mean you just use &lt;hr&gt;, not &lt;hr /&gt; nor &lt;hr>&lt;/hr&gt;.  

Also note that the **hr** tag defines a break in the flow of text and so should be outside the paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) tag.
  
Finally, if you are still having trouble, modify your code to place the emphasis tag (&lt;em&gt;) outside of the paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) tag.  This works around a current issue with the grader.
